# texttables
Simple python text tables reader/writer module.  Similar to csv in interface.

The documentation can be found at [this repository's GitHub
page](https://taywee.github.io/texttables/) or at the [ReadtheDocs
site](https://texttables.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  The GitHub page should be
kept reasonably up-to-date, but the ReadTheDocs site is more guaranteed to, as
it is updated through a webhook.

# Installation

```
pip install texttables
```
